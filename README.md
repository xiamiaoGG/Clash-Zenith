Nyaa~! This is a brand-new evolution from Clash Verge, bestowed with the super awesome name "Clash Zenith" desu~☆  
(Clash-Zenith also uses the Mihomo kernel component)

# 1. About Clash-Zenith  
Since Clash Verge is no longer being updated, I created this enhanced version! Clash-Zenith adds numerous new features to the original Clash Verge!  

# 2. New UI  
*pushes new UI with paw* Look look~ All fresh and sparkly! (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧  

This looks like this owO:  

We use HTML to build the UI because it's very ~~lite~~ lightweight!
